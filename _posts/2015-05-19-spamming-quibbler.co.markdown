title: Spamming quibbler.co

[Quibbler.co] is a really nifty socket.io experiment by 
[@Antrikshy](https://twitter.com/Antrikshy). You should check it out. 

The idea is, everyone goes to this page and can post messages. Everyone can 
see all messages, and all messages disappear a few seconds after they hit the 
screen.  

I wanted to see how easily I could spam my message ("tacos rule") to the
world. What follows is a recreation of my initial attempts. It is very 
rudimentary, manual, and stupid. But I had fun doing it. 

## Mimic the POST 

I navigated to the chat section of quibbler.co and used ngrep to capture 
the posts that I made.
