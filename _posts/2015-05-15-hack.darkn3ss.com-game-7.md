The game I am going through is 
[hack.darkn3ss.com](http://hack.darkn3ss.com/), by 
[@jLynx_DarkN3ss](https://twitter.com/jLynx_DarkN3ss). It is a seven-stage
exercise, centered around bypassing a login screen, with increasing levels of
difficulty. I have broken it into parts to keep individual post size down.

Let's continue. 

## Level: 7 

![Level 7]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/6246a01fa7b7055a8acce3c3a401b285.png)

Initially, survey the source. The careful observer will note that the `Try` 
JavaScript function is a red herring. It is not implemented in the `testi` 
form. 

![Level 7.1]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/53ed5d4653e0d8c210a32c617cdbab8c.png)

Instead, the form POSTs data back to `l7-jded.php`, this page. To test 
whether this will have any effect, enter some test login credentials. 

![Level 7.2]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/b2e828b3e485cda0e79fa70c4d3b35a8.png)

The page reloads, but now with some extra text above the username field: 

![Level 7.3]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/fb937107fe9aa79263e63bde33f28da7.png)

This means that the page is performing some validation behind the scenes, and 
that this is the first challenge in the series that does not have the password
visible or easily accessible. To crack this one, it is necessary to consider 
common methods for data storage. With nothing to indicate otherwise, it is 
reasonable to assume that there could be any number of valid username/password 
combinations. 

Data on the Internet is most commonly stored in a database, and the most common
type of database on the Internet is the SQL database. We should check this 
login form for SQL injection vulnerability.

One simple way to test for SQLi vulnerability is to enter a single quote in 
the input field. Simply closing the input early could be enough to cause a 
hiccup in the authentication.  

![Level 7.4]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/70404c27f2a73b19f0aa0c086f32bbbb.png)

Unfortunately, that does not work, but further options should be tested. We 
should try inserting a statement that resolves to `True`. 

![Level 7.5]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/d81129e26f21ca5c0e5839b0078a717b.png)

It worked!

That concludes the hack.darkn3ss.com challenges.
