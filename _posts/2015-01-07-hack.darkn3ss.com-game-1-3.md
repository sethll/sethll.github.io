I'm trying to get into the practice of 

1. doing extra projects outside of work, and
2. blogging about said projects. 

In this spirit, I have decided to start with at least a couple of online 
hacking games/challenges that I have found entertaining. For the most part 
these are not terribly difficult, but fun exercises nonetheless. 

The first game that I will be going through is 
[hack.darkn3ss.com](http://hack.darkn3ss.com/), by 
[@jLynx_DarkN3ss](https://twitter.com/jLynx_DarkN3ss). It is a seven-stage 
exercise, centered around bypassing a login screen, with increasing levels of
difficulty. I will be breaking it into parts to keep individual post size down
and because I need to get some sleep and I only have the third level written 
up.

Let's get started. 

## Level: 1

![Level 1]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/0ecb89226e6c08c00295823b76eaf8ac.png)

Level 1 meets us with a simple password entry screen. Submitting with a blank 
password or a test password yields a JavaScript alert:

> Wrong password. Noob...

...and we get dumped to a blank page. However, this gives us a clue as to how 
this site might be validating input. Let's check the page source. 

![Level 1.1]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/a8fb94d355071dc0c82c0ccfff89a651.png)

Nice. We can see a JS function being established, `Try`, which sadly has the 
required password written in plaintext. In fact the entire situation is grim, 
client-side authentication is rarely a good thing. Looking further down 
the page, we can see how the function is being implemented in the `testi` form:
Input name `pass` gets handed to the function via the `submit` button. This 
information is not important now, but I suspect it will be later. ;)

We can copy and paste in the password, click submit, and we are on to the next 
level. 

In this level, and in some subsequent ones, we really aren't bypassing the 
login screen; we are just looking for the password, and the site administrator
has been kind or foolish enough to leave it somewhere we could easily find it.
It's the digital equivalent of hiding a sticky note under a stack of papers. 

![Level 1.2]({{ site.url}}/assets/img/52d1b3559c0354957a22c62bbd9f74fe.png)

## Level: 2

Very similar to Level 1, this is just another password field. The source shows
another JavaScript function up top: 

![Level 2.1]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/63c3b7a363c11a0f966853cde2996aa8.png)

...but entering this password won't work. If we check the form, we can see 
that the `submit` button is utilizing a JS function called `Try`; the function
we just looked at is called `Pass`. Let's find that function. 

![Level 2.2]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/2907930df0d4670386cf359859a8f92b.png)

Submitting the `slipup` value as the password, we're done with Level 2. Just 
like Level 1, the password was out where anyone could find it. 

## Level: 3 

![Level 3.1]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/414094005983320f8eb48ffe93709022.png)

This is a full username and password login. Going straight to the source, we 
see multiple blocks of potentially useful JavaScript.

![Level 3.2]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/370a20ed37a2bada0eeef84f94dd02bd.png)

![Level 3.3]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/5a43b2e10380a16898dfb08228c65d77.png)

![Level 3.4]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/789da396ea46f4d71c80e77e4991b867.png)

In order to tell which JS has the real password, let's check out the form. 

{% highlight html %}
<form name="testi">
    username: 
    <input type="text" name="uzr" size="20" class="form-control" onkeydown="if (event.keyCode == 13) document.getElementById('Submit').click()"> <br>
    password: 
    <input type="password" name="pass" size="20" class="form-control" onkeydown="if (event.keyCode == 13) document.getElementById('Submit').click()">
    <br>
    <br>
    <input type="reset" value="Continue" onclick="Tryi(testi.pass.value, testi.uzr.value)" class="btn-danger-filled btn-lg" id="Submit">
</form>
{% endhighlight %}

The third input tag defines the `Submit` button, and what happens when that 
button is clicked. We can see that, on click, it calls a function and passes
two parameters: 

    onclick="Tryi(testi.pass.value, testi.uzr.value)"

Therefore, we know that the pertinent JS is the `Tryi` JS function. 

One last thing: Notice the order the submission button's onclick passes 
parameters. It sends the pass value first... which means... that the username 
and password in the `Tryi` function are *actually* the password and the username.
Tricky. 

Submitting the credentials in this order successfully propels us to Level 4...

![Level 3.5]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/811f62f8f4e1234e5a9fcb67ed40dd8a.png)

... which I will cover in an upcoming post.
