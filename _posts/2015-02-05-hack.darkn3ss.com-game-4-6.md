The game I am going through is 
[hack.darkn3ss.com](http://hack.darkn3ss.com/), by 
[@jLynx_DarkN3ss](https://twitter.com/jLynx_DarkN3ss). It is a seven-stage
exercise, centered around bypassing a login screen, with increasing levels of
difficulty. I will be breaking it into parts to keep individual post size down
and because I need to get some sleep and I only have the third level written
up.

Let's continue. 

## Level: 4 

![Level 4]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/93c07438f6b4a043a9df635e8fad7273.png)

Level 4 looks pretty similar to its predecessor, Level 3. Let's jump into the 
source. Immediately, we can see what's going on by looking directly at the 
form. 

![Level 4.1]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/9c42f51303fd983c504af1ccf80bf7b2.png)

The `onclick` pulls from `testi` for one of the submitted values--the name of 
this form--but for the second value it takes `testii.usr.value`. That's right,
it is drawing from a second form. But there was only one form visible on the 
page! If we keep reading the source, we find: 

![Level 4.2]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/e6b25e2979e9ed49d17129e6764bf174.png)

A second form, this one hidden. In order to submit this form with success, we 
will edit the HTML locally. 

Websites are content that is delivered to your browser in the form of text 
files containing markup and scripting. The web browser interprets these files
and displays what it is told to display. In order to read the files, they have 
to be downloaded onto the local machine; once these files are on the local 
machine, we can edit them however we want. And, because we can see how the 
authentication mechanism is expecting to receive input... 

![Level 4.3]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/bbd97e9f27a42a635c34cc9e734e531d.png)

we can manipulate the page to match what is expected. 

This can be accomplished easily with your browser's Developer Tools (any modern
browser worth its salt will have this toolset available). I will be using 
Firefox; some of the names of tools may be specific to Firefox. 

Open the Inspector, and find the submission JavaScript to get the username and
password. 

![Level 4.4]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/a3c04ded8e98bc10405d5e3ce1d68e1b.png)

Once you have this, let's go to the hidden form and delete the `hidden` 
attribute from the `usr` field. Remember, the JS takes its first input from 
`testi.pass` and its second input from `testii.usr`. 

![Level 4.5]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/317567e4203053453b65e287ed89cad3.png)

Now we can see and enter text into the once-hidden `usr` field. Enter the 
username into `testi.pass` and the password into `testii.usr`. 

![Level 4.6]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/f0ed61eb2879cabc08459a8d9f3e8a36.png)

Click submit and move on to Level 5. 

![Level 4.7]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/2819c2b575b072cdb9e5944f1aaa7909.png)

### Alternative methods

As you might have guessed, the method I used in the above example is just one
way to defeat this exercise. It's pretty simplistic. My personal favorite
methods involve editing the JavaScript. One example: 

![Level 4.8]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/616b9607e9e4eca4104486121609db11.png)

## Level: 5

![Level 5]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/0fbb975b53bd5df680c6d0a6db1009b0.png)

This level is different. Let's look at the source: 

![Level 5.1]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/ee3736de63cbe922f1b353cae7c12eba.png)

Seems too good to be true, but try it anyway. 

![Level 5.2]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/337d5a6a1cfd7f00f598230606aaa289.png)

That was easy. On to Level 6! 

## Level: 6

![Level 6]({{ site.url}}/assets/img/c5b5e9183559c185cfacfbb99aedb45a.png)

This page is using Flash to authenticate. The source immediately presents a 
false flag; trying the visible password yields no positive result. In order to 
solve this one, I needed to decode the Flash object. There are any number
of resources one could use for this; I utilized 
[showmycode.com](http://www.showmycode.com/). 

I copied the link location of `password.swf`... 

![Level 6.1]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/ea4bae63b5a27318543b1e22fe0030a1.png)

... and pasted it into the URL field at `showmycode`. The decoder
then presented me with the information I needed. 

![Level 6.2]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/4cc54fe7b130b6044e66e619e37f18d9.png)

Without any way to be sure which of the strings was the password, I tried the 
second one first. It worked. 

## To be continued...

I will finish this series with my next post, which will cover the final level 
in this game.
