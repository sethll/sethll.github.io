The game I am going through is 
[hack.darkn3ss.com](http://hack.darkn3ss.com/), by 
[@jLynx_DarkN3ss](https://twitter.com/jLynx_DarkN3ss). It is a seven-stage
exercise, centered around bypassing a login screen, with increasing levels of
difficulty. I will be breaking it into parts to keep individual post size down
and because I need to get some sleep and I only have the third level written
up.
