I'm trying to get into the practice of 

1. doing extra projects outside of work, and
2. blogging about said projects. 

In this spirit, I have decided to start with at least a couple of online 
hacking games/challenges that I have found entertaining. For the most part 
these are not terribly difficult, but fun exercises nonetheless. 

The first game that I will be going through is 
[hack.darkn3ss.com](http://hack.darkn3ss.com/), by 
[@jLynx_DarkN3ss](https://twitter.com/jLynx_DarkN3ss). It is a seven-stage 
exercise, centered around bypassing a login screen, with increasing levels of
difficulty.

Let's get started. 

## Level: 1

Level 1 meets us with a simple password entry screen. Clicking *Submit* without
any input does nothing. Submitting a test password clears the field and that's 
it. Let's check the page source.

Nice. We can see a JS function being established, *Try*, which sadly has the 
required password written in plaintext. In fact the entire situation is grim, 
client-side authentication is rarely a good thing. Looking further down 
the page, we can see how the function is being implemented in the *testi* form:
Input name *pass* gets handed to the function via the *submit* button. This 
information is not important now, but I suspect it will be later. ;)

We can copy and paste in the password, click submit, and we are on to the next 
level. 

## Level: 2
